# üß† Machine Learning ‚Äî Motto  

> *If humans can read data and predict the target value (car price, share market value), why not machines?*

## üí° Introduction  

The most popular language used for **Machine Learning** is **Python**, with powerful libraries such as:  

- **NumPy (Numerical Python)**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Scikit-learn**  

Other languages like **R**, **Java**, and **MATLAB** are also evolving in the Machine Learning ecosystem.

## üåç Real-Life Scenarios  

There are countless real-world applications where Machine Learning can predict outcomes, such as:  

- **Gold price prediction**  
- **Customer churn rate**  
- **Disease diagnosis**  
- **Stock market forecasting**  

Depending on the use case, we can choose an appropriate model ‚Äî broadly categorized into **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** Machine Learning.

## üß© Supervised Machine Learning  

Supervised ML involves training a model on **labeled data** (data with known outputs).  

### üîπ Algorithms in Supervised ML  

1. **Linear Regression**  
   - Used when the target variable (**y**) is a **number** (e.g., predicting house prices).  

2. **Logistic Regression / Classification Models**  
   - Used when the target variable is **boolean** (e.g., *Yes/No*, *True/False*).  
   - Despite its name, **Logistic Regression** is used for **classification**, not regression.  
   - Logistic Regression applies a **Sigmoid** function to Linear Regression to map output between 0 and 1.  
   - Classification types:  
     - **Single-Class Classification:** Target has two possible outcomes (Yes/No).  
     - **Multi-Class Classification:** Target has more than two classes (e.g., *Stage 1*, *Stage 2*, *Stage 3* in cancer detection).  

3. **Ranking Models**  
   - Used when target variables are ranked based on user preference (e.g., Amazon product ranking).  
   - Common algorithms:  
     - **Neural Networks**  
     - **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**  
     - **LambdaRank**

## üîç Unsupervised Machine Learning  

In **Unsupervised ML**, the model is trained on **unlabeled data** ‚Äî data with **no known target values**.  

Here, the goal is to **find hidden patterns or groupings** in the data.  

Common techniques include:  

- **Clustering**  
- **Autoencoders**  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

## üèÅ Summary  

| Category | Data Type | Goal | Common Techniques |
|-----------|------------|------|--------------------|
| **Supervised ML** | Labeled | Predict known output | Linear/Logistic Regression, Ranking Models |
| **Unsupervised ML** | Unlabeled | Find hidden patterns | Clustering, Autoencoders, PCA |
